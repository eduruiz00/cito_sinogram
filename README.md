## Sinogram generation

**Guillem Casals and Eduard Ruiz**

This project contains the `foam_generator.py` file with the `FoamGenerator` class to generate the phantom. The `sinogram_generator.py` file contains the code to generate a sinogram, add noise and reconstruct. Different representations are generated to visualize the sinograms and reconstructions with certain degrees of noise.

To run the code, run through the terminal:

```
python3 sinogram_generator.py
```

It is important to have an environment with the Astra toolbox installed in order to run the code.
